======================
- I enjoyed the Targil and the using of the API. I think the API is very clear
and useful.

- On game_loop I chose to run the function cares for checking if the spaceship
got his by an asteroid before the function for removing dead asteroids and
torpedoes in order to add the asteroid that hit the spaceship to the list of
dead asteroids before their removing if necessary

- I made the task in bonus 2 on main()
